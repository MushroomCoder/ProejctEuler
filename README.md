# Project Euler
In this repository you can find my solutions to the problems of https://projecteuler.net

All my solutions are written in pure Python and are as commented as possible 
to explain the exact way of solving the problem I adopted. I try to respect the PEP8 convention too
and write the most clean elegant and redable code.

Hope you will enjoy this and do not cheat guys :wink: :fire:
